# lempcompose
Hello, this is a test string to check the second commit.

This is a third try to commit from the remote machine.

Edited nginx port number to 8000 since 80 is in use.

Works good now:
1) git pull https://github.com/johnhowardkh/lempcompose
2) sudo docker-compose up -d
3) curl localhost:8000
